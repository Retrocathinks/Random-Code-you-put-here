# Random-Code-you-put-here
What i mean by put random code that does something and it will be used for a project for example,

import string
import random

def get_random_letter():
    # depends how you want to randomize getting your letter
    return random.choice(string.letters)

random_letters = []
for i in range(500):
    random_letter = get_random_letter()
    random_letters.append(random_letter)

with open("text.txt", 'w') as f:
    f.write("".join(random_letters))

Something liek that
